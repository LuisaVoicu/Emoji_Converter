the bird flies quickly
a big dog runs happily
she dances gracefully
we study carefully

the cat jumps proud
an old tree sleeps gracefully
3 birds sing loudly
they listen quietly

I draw patiently
the moon watch curiously at me
I paint rarely
human brave like you 

3 cats
9  cars

happy birthday
welcome home

the golden rays of the setting sun painted the sky in hues of orange and pink
casting a warm glow over the tranquil rippling lake
